PortDB
======

A network port database mini site. I was driven mad by the lack of information on ports and the applications they map to, so I've started this database for my own information.

Please feel free to add information, the format for notes is going to stay the same, other than adding 
Markdown support soon.

This is a quick site I built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). It's also hosted on [Github](https://github.com/yaleman/portdb) if you aren't already there.

# Todo

Make some scripts to collect data automagically for the site.
