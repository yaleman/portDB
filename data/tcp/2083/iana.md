_Name:_ radsec

_Description:_ Secure Radius Service

_Note:_ The TCP port 2083 was already
      previously assigned by IANA for "RadSec", an early implementation
      of RADIUS/TLS, prior to issuance of this RFC.  This early
      implementation can be configured to be compatible to RADIUS/TLS as
      specified by the IETF.  See <xref type="rfc" data="rfc6614"/>,
      Appendix A for details.
